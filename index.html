    <h2>Turkey</h2>
    <img src="images/Turkey.jpg" alt="Turkey Hatay landscape">
    <p>Turkey is the southernmost province and metropolitan municipality of Turkey.
        It is situated mostly outside Anatolia, along the eastern coast of the Levantine Sea. 
        The province borders Syria to its south and east, the Turkish province of Adana to the northwest, 
        Osmaniye to the north, and Gaziantep to the northeast. It is partially in Çukurova, a large fertile plain along Cilicia.
        Its administrative capital is Antakya (ancient Antioch), making it one of the three Turkish provinces not named after its administrative capital or any settlement.
        The second-largest city is İskenderun (formerly Alexandretta). Sovereignty over most of the province remains disputed with neighbouring Syria, 
        which claims that the province had a demographic Arab majority, and was separated from itself against the stipulations of the French Mandate of Syria in
        the years following Syria's occupation by France after World War 1.
